									<h2>About Me</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									I'm currently the Network and Mapping Specialist at <a href="https://peopleforbikes.org/" target="_blank">PeopleForBikes</a>, a national bike advocacy organization headquartered in Boulder, CO. My role involves a combination of GIS, data wrangling, project management, and technical communications. 
								<p>	
									In 2017, I completed a research-based M.A. in Geography at CU Boulder studying geographic and statistical error in U.S. Census data. I'm passionate about understanding how data succeeds or fails to represent people accurately, and ensuring that the fruits of data analysis are accessible to a wide range of information consumers. Check out my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebeccamdavies/" target="_blank">LinkedIn profile</a> for my complete resume.
								<p>	
									I'm a lifelong learner and am always developing new skills to benefit my professional work. In my spare time, I play soccer, occasionally run, explore cities, rescue cats and kittens, and battle Colorado's altitude to bake cakes that rise.

									<h2>Work Samples</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									My expertise lies in the combination of my analytical, technical, and communication skills. Please scroll down for a sample of projects I have worked on.
								<p>
									Technical notes: I primarily use open-source tools for data analysis and visualization, mostly Python (pandas, GeoPandas, SciPy, NumPy, Matplotlib, etc.), as well as R, SQL, and QGIS. I also have experience integrating JavaScript tools for spatial and nonspatial data visualization such as Leaflet, OpenLayers, and D3. I can find my way around HTML and CSS code, and am a quick study when it comes to proprietary tools (ArcGIS, Carto, MapBox, Excel, Tableau, etc.). I'm currently working on further developing my skills using Git, shell scripts, and cloud computing.

										<h3>Bike Network Analysis</h3>
										<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/topekaksheat.jpeg" alt=""></a>
										<p>I'm building out a <a href="https://github.com/peopleforbikes" target="_blank">GitHub organization</a> page for PeopleForBikes with resources to help people visualize data from the <a href="https://bna.peopleforbikes.org/" target="_blank">Bike Network Analysis (BNA)</a>, run the BNA, and use the tool for bike planning. The resources will ultimately include Python and R functions to produce maps, scripts to modify XML files from OpenStreetMap, and a simplified version of the BNA source code (PostgreSQL + shell scripts).</p>

										<h3>Transit Data Analysis</h3>
										<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/dash.jpg" alt=""></a>
										<p>As a temporary data analyst for the Boulder County Transportation Department, I used Python to analyze and visualize transit usage data. I employed the pandas library to perform SQL-like queries to answer questions of interest to the department such as the demographics of transit riders, ridership patterns, and smart card usage. I visualized the results of these inquiries for inclusion in a final grant report that the department provided to funders. (The data is private and so not illustrated here.)</p>

										<h3>Master's Thesis</h3>
										<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic01.png" alt=""></a>
										<p>In May 2017, I completed my master's thesis entitled "Bridging the Data-Theory Divide Using Regionalization and Uncertainty for Neighborhood Identification." My thesis addressed the intersection of theory-driven definitions of neighborhoods based on political, cultural, and physical attributes, and data-driven neighborhood identification based on demographic data from the American Community Survey. The project primarily used Python with an emphasis on network graph analytics.</p>

									<div class="row">
										<h3>Uncertainty in U.S. Census Data</h3>
										<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/acs.PNG" alt=""></a>
										<p>Throughout graduate school I worked as a Research Assistant for Professor Seth Spielman, supporting his and collaborators' research addressing uncertainy in census data and measuring social vulnerabilty to natural hazards. I built a GitHub-based resource to house results from the research, which provided access to small-scale census data, maps, and visualizations containing reduced data uncertainty for researchers. </p>

									<div class="row">
										<h3>Target Market Analysis</h3>
										<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/frsl.JPG" alt="">
										</a>
										<p>As a case study for a Denver-area foundation, I produced a target market analysis concerning a proposed program serving Denver metro area public school students.</p>
